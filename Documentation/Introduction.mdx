title: 'What is DefendStack?'
---

"DefendStack" is a new open source cybersecurity project designed to provide powerful, enterprise-grade security tools that are easy to deploy, easy to use, and accessible to businesses of all sizes and budgets. It addresses the challenges organizations face with existing security solutions by offering features like integration with popular version control systems (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab), runtime scanning via webhooks, and false positive management — all without the hefty price tag typically associated with advanced cybersecurity tools.

**Who We Are, What Is Our Vision?**

We are a team committed to making cybersecurity accessible to all. Our vision is simple: to deliver state-of-the-art security solutions that empower businesses to "shift left"—identifying and preventing security issues early in the development process rather than reacting after breaches occur. We believe that every organization deserves access to robust cybersecurity measures without the burden of high costs, and we're dedicated to breaking down the barriers that have made advanced security solutions inaccessible for so long.
