# Welcome to DefendStack Warzone

## What is DefendStack Warzone?

DefendStack - Warzone is our **live, community-driven playground for security enthusiasts**.
Think of it as a warzone where developers, security engineers, and ethical hackers can **test, break, and defend** against real-world scenarios, all powered by the DefendStack Suite.

It’s not a Capture the Flag in the traditional sense, it’s a **living lab** where our open-source DevSecOps platform is deployed, and your mission is to find vulnerabilities, test defenses, and share your findings. Every test makes DefendStack stronger.

## Introduction to DevSecOps

DevSecOps is about making **security a natural part of development** instead of a roadblock.

* DevOps gave us speed.
* DevSecOps adds **trust and resilience** to that speed.

At its core, DevSecOps means:

* **Shift-left security** → catching issues early in the pipeline
* **Automation** → security checks that run in CI/CD, not after release
* **Collaboration** → developers and security working as one team, not two silos

DefendStack embodies this philosophy by giving teams a full stack of **open-source security capabilities** without the enterprise bloatware.
