## Asset Grouping

Asset Grouping is a powerful feature that enables security teams to organize and monitor different types of assets collectively rather than individually. This feature, combined with dynamic scoring, provides a comprehensive view of your security posture at a group level.

### Purpose

* Track security scores at a group level

* Simplify security management for large-scale deployments

* Enable team-based or project-based security tracking
